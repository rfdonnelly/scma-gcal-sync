  description: "Trip leader: Greg Vernon, Michael Gordon\nIf you enjoy the atmosphere and steep climbing of Holcomb Valley Pinnacles (San Bernardino Mtns), you will love Church Dome!   Travel instructions and other good beta can be found on the Mountain Project site, although MP mis-characterizes CD as \"well-bolted sport climbs\". You will not do much climbing if you only show up with quickdraws! A full rack is highly recommended. http://mountainproject.com/v/church-domes/105874984  Church Dome is best for leaders who are comfortable leading 5.8+ (most climbs need to be led first in order to TR), but everyone is welcome.  This is a beautiful time of year in a beautiful Southern Sierra setting, and our campsite is great with a running creek nearby.\n"

  description: "Climbing at Bart Dome, Domeland Wilderness, Southern Sierra Nevada, CA\nBart Dome is one of the premier granite in Southern Sierra with single to 3-pitch routes rated from 5.8 to 5.10 trad/bolted climbs. The dome is located about 7 miles from the trailhead so we will backpack in and stay overnight in wilderness for 2 nights.\nWe will meet at the Manter Meadow Trailhead around 1PM on Friday, 6/5 and hike in together. Although there is Manter Creek that runs parellel along the trail, be prepare to bring in water as a backup since the stream may not have sufficient water due to drought.\nPlease subscribe to this event if you're interested in attending this trip. I will update with more info in the comment section of this trip as we get closer to the trip weekend.\nDriving Direction: Take 5N to 14N. Turn left onto 178W about 10 miles after Red Rock Canyon State Park. At Weldon, turn right onto Sierra Way which becomes Mountain Hwy 99 after Kernville. 19.6 miles after Kernville, turn right onto Sherman Pass Rd(22S05). After 6 miles turn right onto Cherry Hill Rd(22S12). After 11.6 miles turn left at the north intersection of Big Meadow Loop Rd(23S07) and look for Manter Meadow Trailhead (34E14).\nTo Bart Dome from trailhead: hike east about 3 miles to Manter Meadow. Hike north up Manter Meadow for a few miles until the trail splits; left (34E08)to Woodpecker Meadow and right (34E10) into Tibbets Creek and Rockhouse Basin. Soon you can see Bart Dome down and to the right.\nGPS coordinates: 35.887229, -118.332758\n"

  description: "Have you ever looked at an anchor and wondered: how equalized is this thing? Does it really matter? Can it even be achieved? Is the angle between pieces critical (maybe not as much as you think)? Is the direction of pull really that important?\nIf you’re looking to improve your anchor building skills or just need a refresher, come on out and join the fun in J-Tree with Thom Wolfsen as he discusses the finer points of constructing load distribution systems. This day-long clinic will combine discussion with plenty of hands-on practice in building strong, safe anchors for toprope, single-pitch and multi-pitch climbing. Topics covered will include: static vs. dynamic load distribution, building anchors in series, dynamic elongation, how single-point failure can compromise multi-point anchors and much more. You’ll learn and practice the tips, tricks and techniques that will enable you to have confidence in your anchors wherever you may build them, while challenging the skills you already possess.\nNote: There is no charge for the clinic but we can only accommodate 12 people, so contact Thom at VI511A4@hotmail.com to sign-up.\nNote: There is no charge for the clinic but we can only accommodate 12 people, so contact Thom atÂÂ VI511A4@hotmail.comÂÂ to sign-up.\nWhen: Sunday, January 15th, 2017\nWhere: Real Hidden Valley, Joshua Tree National Park; South end of Sports Challenge Rock.\nTime: 8:00 a.m. until 4:00 p.m. (meet at the parking lot area)\n"

Shasta via Avalanche Gulch that includes instruction and practice in the basics of mountaineering for those that need it. Â Â We’ll re view basic crampon and ice axe use, self-arrest, snow anchors and basic crevasse rescue.Â While many climbers storm the mountain doing 2 or 3-day ascents, our slower pace will enable us to practice our mountaineering skills and allows us extra time to acclimatize before our summit attempt while hanging out with our fellow club members enjoying the beauty of Mt. Shasta’s wilderness.\nNo previous mountaineering experience is required for this trip but you should be in good physical condition and have previous backpacking experience (especially winter). The itinerary is flexible depending on the final group make-up and we can make adjustments depending on the skill set and desires of the group.\nFor details about the trip, check out the Mountaineering “Trip Planning” section of the forum.\nGroup size: limited to 8 people. Trip rating: S2\nTrip leader: Thom Wolfsen\nCo-leader: Â Alexander SmirnoffÂ \n"

  description: "Shuteye Ridge is an area riddled with granite and lush moss covered forest. It is located in the Western Sierras South of Yosemite and East of Bass Lake. There are no official campgrounds, bathrooms, or water. It is undeveloped remote camping and you must bring your own supplies. Climbing areas range from walking distance to miles of approach and offer everything from runout slab to vertical sport on runnels.\nLeader: Â Randy Worth Â \nThere will be two groups leaving Friday. One group going in the morning and my group leaving in the evening after work. This year will be chilly with more snow than usual so be prepared for mountain weather. Vehicles must be AWD with chains at a minimum. There will be multiple 4wheel drive trucks going to fit anyone in need of a ride.\nWe will be camping at Big Sleep Dome climbing area which is considered Brown’s Meadow. Anyone interested in coming must email me, Randy Worth, to discuss vehicle/rides.\nHere is my trip report from last year on mountain project:\nhttp://www.supertopo.com/climbers-forum/2820646/Shuteye-Ridge-Conditions-Report\nHere are the directions that Trish Stoops has created:\nThe Road names in this area vary depending on which map you use. Â Do not use Googlemaps. Â I know you all love google but the names they give don’t match what’s actually out there. Â Look at mapquest and you’ll see the correct street names. PLEASE NOTE THAT I HAVE NOT FOUND ANY GPS SYSTEM THAT CORRECTLY SHOWS THE DIRT ROADS THAT YOU ENCOUNTER TOWARDS THE END, SO FROM THAT POINT, TURN OFF YOUR GPS, READ THE DIRECTIONS, AND CHECK OFF THE MILEAGE LISTED BELOW Â ;o)\nÂ \nFrom Fresno take Hwy 41 north to North Fork Road, turn right (may also be called Road 200). Travel east to North Fork. Â When you get close to North Fork you’ll pass Manzinita road on the left. Keep straight and the road you’re on will become Mammoth Road, which intersects with Malum Road (Malum Road leads to Bass Lake – so pass it and head straight going up the hill) Â  From that intersection, keep going on Mammoth Road for 22 miles. Â Its all paved. Â You may see some road signs that say “Minarets Road” but mostly its called Mammoth Road and later on it will be called Mammoth Pool Road and eventually you’ll see a few signs designating it as “81.”\nÂ \nTowards the beginning of those 22 miles you will come to a Y-intersection. Â Take the left fork of the Y. Â Road 225 goes right, Mammoth Pool Road is to the left. Â KEEP LEFT. Â Along the way you’ll pass two fire stations, and Powerhouse Road and you’ll go through a large section of burned forest. Â At the 22 mile mark you’ll see ROCK CREEK CAMPGROUND on the right. WE ARE NOT STAYING AT ROCK CREEK CAMPGROUND, ITS JUST A LANDMARK!\nÂ \nThe location of Rock Creek Campground that is shown on Googlemaps and Mapquest seems to not match up with what is really out there, so PLEASE, don’t blindly follow your GPS from this point. Â Many people end up lost by doing so.\nÂ \nDrive another 3/4 mile past Rock Creek Campground and you’ll see a dirt road that Y’s off to the left with a sign that says “Brown’s Meadow and Whiskey Falls” Â Take that dirt road for 7.3 miles (The guidebook refers to this as Road 7S02 – don’t search for it on a map using that name – you won’t find it).Â \nÂ \nTake the dirt road, 7S02, for 7.3 miles. Â Turn HARD right onto 7S02M Â (there is a tiny marker that actually says 7S02M). Â From there its another ½ mile of bumpy road to our camp.\nÂ \nNote: you’ll pass many 7S02 offshoots but they will NOT appear in Alphabetical order, so don’t be thrown off by that, just drive the 7.3 miles and you’ll be fine Â :O)\nÂ \nThe road opens onto a beautiful flat slab below Big Sleep Dome. Â This is CAMP. Â There are several fire pits / camp spots along the slab, and there will likely be other groups there.\n"

Club campsites are July 2nd and July 3rd. Obviously members need to purchase campsites on their own to make this trip a 5 day outing.\nThose that have, offer the extra occupancy to SCMA members. If you are one of the lucky participants it’s customary to contribute to the cost of the site with the member that purchases it, that includes parking fees if any.\nIf you would like to attend this trip and need help, contact the trip leader (scmajohnxrcs@gmail.com) for direction, camping and any pertinent info about this trip.Â \nTo book a campsite, go online to PG&E's recreation site at recreation.pge.com\nEnlarge map and click on Trapper Springs Campground. Continue and you will need to register with address, phone etc. See availability and to book.Â \nAlso the camp host will sell sites there at the campground for first come first serve basis.\nTrip leaders will not enforce guidelines for wearing masks, social distancing or hand washing/sanitizing. Personal protective equipment, such as masks and hand sanitizer, will not be provided to trip participants by trip leaders. Before registering for a trip, participants should decide if these parameters are acceptable to them. It should be clearly understood that any safeguards or precautions against the transmission of COVID-19 are outside the responsibility of the trip leader and the SCMA. It is the sole responsibility of trip participants to behave in a manner that minimizes transmission by wearing a mask, social distancing and washing hands when appropriate.\n"
