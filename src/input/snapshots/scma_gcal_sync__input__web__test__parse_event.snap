    text: "Officially 5 cars total but there is enough room for 6.  There is also a bathroom between sites 4 and 5 that can accommodate two cars.  There is no sign that says you can't overnight park there.  There is also room for 3 cars at the campground entrance.  Again no sign that says you can't park overnight there.  Beyond that, there is always the option of asking neighbors if they'd be nice enough to let you use their extra spot.\n\nEach site accommodates 6 ppl officially.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\tComment last edited on 1 day ago by Rob Donnelly\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\tRob Donnelly"
