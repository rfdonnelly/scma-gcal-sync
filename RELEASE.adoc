= Release Process

This project uses https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/[cargo-dist].
Creating a release is as simple as creating and pushing a release tag.

== Define Version

 version=x.y.z

== Set Version

NOTE: This requires `cargo-edit`.

 cargo set-version $version

== Commit and Push

 git add Cargo.toml Cargo.lock
 git commit
 git push

== Tag and Push

 git tag v$version
 git push origin v$version

== Relax

Sit back a relax while `cargo-dist` automatically creates a GitHub Release and releaes binaries for each platform.
